# BRICK-GAME

Brick Breaker Game

Welcome to Brick Breaker, a classic arcade game brought to life in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, your goal is to control a paddle to bounce a ball and break colorful bricks. It's a test of your reflexes and precision.

How to Play

Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys to move the paddle horizontally. Your job is to ensure the ball doesn't fall off the screen.

The ball will bounce off the paddle and destroy bricks. Hit the bricks repeatedly to break them.

Keep an eye on the lives displayed at the bottom left. You start with 3 lives. Losing a ball will cost you one life. The game is won when all bricks are cleared, and it's lost if you run out of lives.

As you progress through levels, the bricks may become harder to break. The game provides a delightful challenge for players of all ages.

Enjoy the game and aim for the highest score! Have fun breaking those bricks!
